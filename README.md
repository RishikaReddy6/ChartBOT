## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  Upload CSV.
2.  Natural-language prompt is passed to Gemini.
3.  AI returns a JSON spec (chart type, columns, and filters).
4.  DataFrame is filtered (if needed).
5.  Plotly builds an interactive chart.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

-   **Add new charts**: edit `make_chart()` in `app.py`.
-   **Tweak prompts**: adjust `full_prompt` in `parse_prompt_with_gemini()` for different keys.
-   **Offline mode**: replace Gemini calls with your own rule-based parser.
